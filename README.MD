# Talking Clock Coding Challenge

Within the team, we don't like clocks that display as numbers. In fact, we like clocks that present the current time in 
a more _"Human Friendly"_ way.

## Objective 1

Write a command-line program that returns the current time using the "Human Friendly Text" demonstrated in the example below.

Numeric Time Human Friendly Text -

* 1:00 One o'clock
* 2:00 Two o'clock
* 13:00 One o'clock
* 13:05 Five past one
* 13:10 Ten past one
* 13:25 Twenty five past one
* 13:30 Half past one
* 13:35 Twenty five to two
* 13:55 Five to two

For example, if we execute this program at 16:30, it should output "Half past four"

`$ ..some command..`
`Half past four`

## Objective 2

Allow the command to take an arbitrary Numeric Time parameter as input and return the "Human Friendly Text" equivalent.

For example:

`$ ..some command.. 15:00`
`Three o'clock`

## Objective 3

Write a REST service to expose the clock and allow an optional parameter to pass the arbitrary Numeric Time like Objective 2, returning the "Human Friendly Text" as JSON.
